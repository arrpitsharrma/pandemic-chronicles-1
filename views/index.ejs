              Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and
              others. Why? When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray
              small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain
              virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets,
              including the COVID-19 virus if the person has the disease.
