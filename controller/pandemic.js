  "description": "Swine influenza (also known as swine flu or pig flu) is a respiratory disease that occurs in pigs that is caused by the Influenza A virus. Influenza viruses that are normally found in swine are known as swine influenza viruses (SIVs). The known SIV strains include influenza C and the subtypes of influenza A known as H1N1, H1N2, H3N1, H3N2 and H2N3. Pigs can also become infected with the H4N6 and H9N2 subtypes.[citation needed] Swine influenza virus is common throughout pig populations worldwide. Transmission of the virus from pigs to humans is not common and does not always lead to human influenza, often resulting only in the production of antibodies in the blood. If transmission does cause human influenza, it is called zoonotic swine flu or a variant virus. People with regular exposure to pigs are at increased risk of swine flu infection. The meat of an infected animal poses no risk of infection when properly cooked. Pigs experimentally infected with the strain of swine flu that caused the human pandemic of 2009â€“10 showed clinical signs of flu within four days, and the virus spread to other uninfected pigs housed with the infected ones.",

  "symptoms": "Fever(not always), chills, cough, sore throat, Fatigue, diarrhoea, Watery, red eyes",
  "complications": "Exacerbation of underlying chronic disease;Complications related to the upper airways, including sinusitis or otitis; Miscellaneous conditions, including cardiac (myocarditis and pericarditis), myositis, rhabdomyolysis, central nervous system complications (encephalopathy, encephalitis, seizures), toxic shock syndrome, and secondary bacterial pneumonia.",
  "usual_onset": "The known incubation period for H1N1 swine flu ranges from 1 to 4 days, with the average around 2 days in most individuals, but some individuals, it may be as long as 7 days. The contagious period for adults starts about 1 day before symptoms develop and lasts around 5 to 7 days after the person develops symptoms.",
  "specialty": "Infectious disease",
  "prevention": "The best way to prevent swine flu is to get a yearly flu vaccination. Other easy ways to prevent swine flu include: frequently washing hands with soap or hand sanitizer. not touching your nose, mouth, or eyes (The virus can survive on surfaces like telephones and tabletops.)",
  "type/pre human host": "pigs",
  "treatment": "Some of the same antiviral drugs that are used to treat seasonal flu also work against H1N1 swine flu. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), peramivir (Rapivab), and zanamivir (Relenza) seem to work best, although some kinds of swine flu don't respond to oseltamivir. These drugs can help you get well faster.",
